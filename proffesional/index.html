 <mark style="color: teal;font-size:24;font-weight: 900;font-style: oblique;background-color: wheat;">   React is a JavaScript library that aims to simplify development of visual interfaces.</mark>
 Developed at Facebook and released to the world in 2013, it drives some of the most widely used code in the world, powering Facebook and Instagram among many, many other software companies.

 Its primary goal is to make it easy to reason about an interface and its state in any point in time, by dividing the UI into a collection of components.
 
 React is used to build single-page web applications, among with many other libraries and frameworks that were available before React came into life.
</p>
<h1 class='qwe'> Why is React so popular?</h1>
<p class="q">
    <mark style="color: teal;font-size:24;font-weight: 900;font-style: oblique;background-color: wheat;">   React.js library is less complex than other libraries to use.</mark>
At the time when React was announced, Ember.js and Angular 1.x were the predominant choices as a framework. Both these imposed too many conventions on the code that porting an existing app was not convenient at all. React made a choice to be very easy to integrate into an existing project, because that’s how they had to do it at Facebook in order to introduce it to the existing codebase. Also, those 2 frameworks brought too much to the table, while React only chose to implement the View layer instead of the full MVC stack.

Perfect timing
At the time, Angular 2.x was announced by Google, along with the backwards incompatibility and major changes it was going to bring. Moving from Angular 1 to 2 was like moving to a different framework, so this, along with execution speed improvements that React promised, made it something developers were eager to try.

Backed by Facebook
Being backed by Facebook obviously is going to benefit a project if it turns to be successful, but it’s not a guarantee, as you can see from many failed open source projects by both Facebook and Google as an example.
